## Mission

The first Undergraduate Architecture (uArch) Mentoring Workshop is designed to introduce late-stage undergraduate students and early-stage graduate students to research and career opportunities in the field of computer architecture in particular and graduate school lifestyle and survival skills in general. The program will include technical sessions that cover past, current and future research directions in computer architecture, mentoring sessions that cover how to apply to graduate school and how to navigate the architecture research landscape effectively, and networking sessions that create opportunities for students to interact with their peers and established architects in academia and industry. 

## Mechanics

The central theme of this workshop is to attract undergraduate students and early-stage graduate students who are interested in graduate school in computer architecture. To this end, uArch will likely include:
* **The Route to Graduate School**: Students will learn how to apply to graduate school, how to find their research interests, how to talk with a potential advisor, etc.
* **Life at Graduate School**: The workshop will include keynote talks from academic and industry leaders about how to thrive at graduate school.
* **Computer Architecture Research Landscape**: The workshop will include technical sessions covering history, current state-of-the-art research and challenging problems that are left unsolved.
* **Meet an “Architect in Process’’**: As part of the workshop, attendees will be paired with students who are pursuing a Ph.D. degree in computer architecture to hear their first-hand experience about research and life at graduate school and build a mentor-mentee relationship.
* **Ask an Architect**: The workshop will include a panel of established architects in the industry and academia from whom students can seek career advice.

## Application Submission
* **Eligibility**: Applicants must be undergraduate students in their last or second-to-last year or first-year graduate students in computer science or related fields as of fall 2019.  Students from around the world are welcome to apply. *Applications from underrepresented groups in computing are especially welcome.*
* **Required Documents**: 
  * A statement of purpose explaining why you want to attend this workshop.
* **Optional**:
  * A note from the student’s advisor (if any) or teacher recommending them for the workshop.

Applicants who are selected for the workshop will have travel, hotel, and conference registration costs covered for the workshop and the main program of the conference. **Attendees are expected to stay from Sunday through Wednesday morning and to attend both the workshop and the conference main program.**

**Note for non-US applicants:** It is possible that we will need to cap travel funding in order to reach the most students.  We expect that travel funding will be sufficient to cover domestic flights, but may not be enough to fully cover some international flights and/or visa costs.  Being accepted does not obligate attendence, so we encourage students to apply and if they are accepted but funding is insufficient, they may then decline.

**Note for women undergraduate and graduate students** ACM-W provides support for women undergraduate and graduate students in Computer Science and related programs to attend research conferences. The application deadline is April 15 for conferences taking place in June—July, 2019.   For more information and to apply visit [here](https://women.acm.org/scholarships).
